### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I recently was certified in full-stack web development. By day I work as an Associate Software Engineer at Spok focused on front-end development utlizing React and TypeScript. By night I am a teaching assistant at a full-stack web development boot camp. I volunteer on a local political candidate's campaign team to keep their website up-to-date. Before my web dev life I worked in medical device engineering.
